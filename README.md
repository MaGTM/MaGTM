## About me

Hi there! My name is Maxim and I am a 19-year-old frontend developer living in Astana, Kazakhstan. I am passionate about creating intuitive and visually appealing user experiences, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and grow as a developer.

I have a strong foundation in React, Redux, Material UI, SCSS, CSS modules, Jest, Storybook, TypeScript, and JavaScript. These technologies have allowed me to build efficient and scalable applications, and I am always eager to learn more about new tools and techniques in the frontend ecosystem.

Currently, I am actively searching for a job in the field of frontend development. I am excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a team and contribute to the creation of meaningful projects.

In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest developments in the tech industry and participating in online coding challenges and hackathons. I also enjoy playing video games and spending time with friends and family.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I am excited to see what the future holds and continue to grow as a developer.
