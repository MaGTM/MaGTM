## About me

Hello!

I am a front-end developer with 1.5 years of experience in developing frontend applications, including one year of commercial development.

In my development work, I actively utilize the following technologies: React, NextJS, VueJS, TypeScript, Webpack, Vite, TailwindCSS, FSD, Zustand, React Query, and Redux (RTK).

I possess strong software and well-honed hard skills. Additionally, I have two truly exceptional skills that greatly assist me in life - high self-organization and the ability to learn continuously and rapidly. I am particularly enthusiastic about solving complex problems and seeking efficient solutions. My passion for development and my drive for professional growth always motivate me to achieve outstanding results.
